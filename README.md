# INTEGRATING DIMENSION REDUCTION AND AUGMENTATION METHODS FOR ENHANCED FINGERPRINT CLASSIFICATION

## 🔍 Why This Project?
This project focuses on fingerprint classification using deep learning. The goal is to build a secure and efficient biometric system by comparing multiple combinations of feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification techniques to identify the most accurate model.

## 📂 Dataset Source
The fingerprint dataset used in this project consists of labeled fingerprint images, preprocessed and organized into multiple classes. (Specify source here if it's public or institutional.)
